# Ski Shop

[View the live project here.](https:https://ski-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/)

This project was created as part of my Milestone Project 4 with Code Institute Web Application Development course.

For the project and to demonstrate what I have learned in the course, we needed to create an e-commerce store and have decided to create a ski shop.
The main goal of the website is to be an online shop for skiers to buy ski equipment.

**Typograpghy**

The main font I have used is the ‘Lato’ for its clean and minimal look with the backup font as sans-serif font if there were any problems using the first choice.

**Imagery**

The images for the hero carousel on the home page was sourced from Unsplash. The images chosen to show what the website is about but also to give visual clue as where the button directed to if user click on the button.
