# Ski Shop

[View the live project here.](https:https://ski-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/)

This project was created as part of my Milestone Project 4 with Code Institute Web Application Development course.

For the project and to demonstrate what I have learned in the course, we needed to create an e-commerce store and have decided to create a ski shop.
The main goal of the website is to be an online shop for skiers to buy ski equipment.
